# Simple x11 framebuffer engine ig (wip)

ctx still needs some adjusting to work with deno's ffi

but after that i will be able to make games in the hottest

languege ever :3

currently linux only, windows support is in theory possible

but not a priority

should work on pixel format and surface scaling

the text function gets into infinit loop (needs fix)
